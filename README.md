# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Data
by Victoria Perez Mola

## Introduction 
The project consists in building a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
that contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

## Learning objectives
Have a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and to apply neural networks to solve real prediction problems.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository 
2. run !pip install requirements.txt
